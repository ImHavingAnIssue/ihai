# Fake YouTube Website

## Overview

This is a simple static website that simulates the appearance of YouTube in dark mode. The project is built using only HTML and CSS, providing a basic structure for a video-sharing platform. The design includes a header with a logo and search bar, a sidebar for navigation, and a main content area for displaying video cards. This project is perfect for beginners looking to practice their web development skills, especially in building layouts and styling with CSS.

## Features

- **Dark Mode Design**: The website features a dark-themed UI with a background color of dark grey and text in white, offering a modern look similar to YouTube's dark mode.
- **Responsive Layout**: The website uses CSS Grid for the video section, making it adaptable to various screen sizes.
- **Header**: The header contains a logo, a search bar, and a user menu icon. It resembles the top bar commonly seen on video-sharing platforms.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: The sidebar offers basic navigation links such as Home, Trending, Subscriptions, Library, and History.
- **Video Section**: Displays video cards in a grid layout. Each card contains a placeholder for a thumbnail, a video title, a channel name, and view count information.
- **Placeholder Elements**: Since this is a static website, the thumbnails and video information are placeholders meant to represent how a real video-sharing platform might look.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the website.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file containing the styling rules for the website, including dark mode colors, layout configurations, and hover effects.
